# FastAPI-Machine-Learning
Using the Iris dataset, train models to solve the following: KNN, Random Forest Classifier, SVM classifier, and a logistic regression classifier. Using FastApi, create an endpoint for each model that will allow you to pass in a target to each endpoint and execute the model
# Using FastApi, creating an endpoint for each model that will allow you to pass in a target to each endpoint and execute the model.
## Let's try KNN model 
As we can see there are 4 endpoints, one for each model and it allows us to pass 4 features to get the prediction: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length and petal_width.
